Note: if you can program it (or have the script/plugin) to loop the files without the intro, it is recommended to use the RPG Maker version instead.

Example of such script, Introloop for Unity: http://exceed7.com/introloop/

The files in this general pack are designed to loop in its entirety. However, some reverb tails might make it sound a bit unnatural when played back for the first time. It is recommended to add a little fade-in for the first playback or combine it with some SFX, for example, the transition SFX from map to battle screen like in FF games.

For Victory1, there are 2 parts, the Fanfare and the Result. The use case is you would play the Fanfare once and loop the Result. They are 2 separate music that works together, so you can try to match the beat (like the RPG Maker version), crossfade, fade-out the Fanfare and fade-in the Result right after, or simply use one file without using the other. Be creative!

Enjoy making games!
